Disclaimer: In this project we’ll write a simulation of several types of investors. Obviously, there will be a lot of
assumptions made in this project and it should in no way be seen as a realistic modelling tool rather than
programming exercise. Should you want to make any adjustment to make the case more realistic you are invited to
do so, however, don’t get lost in this and make sure that you focus on the main goal of this project: using,
understanding and structuring Python code.
